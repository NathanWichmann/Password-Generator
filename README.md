# Password-Generator
This repository (Password Generator) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to famililarize students with 
Javascript. The task was to design a simple password generator using prompt, confirm and alert, which are popup boxes in Javascript. These tools are the easiest way to 
communicate with an html document. Javascript, combined with html and css, make a fully dynamic website and allow users to interact with the webites features.

# Assignment 
The assignment was to create a password generator for an employee that deals sensative information. This would allow them to create more secure passwords to increase security 
to that information. 

# Installation: Password Generator 
While the above assignment appears to be easy on the surface, it proved to be extremely difficult in its implementation. Before I get into the specific details of the 
Javascript code itself, I need to address the first major hurdle I can into in this course. I had read over the Unit Ahead material from Sarah before I started the assignment. Thinking I had a pretty good understanding on primitive data types, objects, functions and scope and rules surrounding these, so I began the assignment. I started off with building the arrays and making sure everything was coded properly and there were not extra commas ot brackets. Everything was ok until I started looking at the code provided to give me an idea of where I needed to start and end up. Here is where the first major hurlde of the course came into play. I had no idea what I was looking at what I need to do to started. With the other assignemtn there was a clear direction in my mind in what I need to do and how need to get there. This assignment was not the same. Getting from point A, to point B had never seemed so daunting. 
I knew I was in trouble. I knew I needed to get a tutor immediatly. I signed up for a tutor that same day and we had our first session the next day. It was only with his help and guidance I was able to start the assignment at all. I told him I understood the theory but that I was completly at a loss as to where to even begin. I must also admit that I had started the assignment a week before it was due and we had not been taught the majority of what we needed to know for the assignment. Thats why the due date was extended. 
I do now have a good understanding of the work and how its implemented.  

# What I Learnt 
There was was a great deal of learning in this homework assignment. I had to do a lot of reading for this assignment. Not only did I learn a great deal from the reading but I learnt that reading alone is only half the battle. Actually Implementing your code is even more difficult. For some reason the use of functions was one of my major hurdles. I understand what they do when looking at them, however when it comes time to making my own, there is a huge roadblock. I learned to take a step back and not be so hard on myself and realize this is only week 4 and to allow myself the room I need to succeed. I also decided not write out everything I did because the javascript page has been commented and this actually becomes redundant. 

# Contributers 
I had a lot of help from my Tutor, Joey. He helped me get the ball rolling.
I had help from my Teachers Assistant Aiden.
I had help from my Instructor Adam, who found the form/button issue that kept refreshing my page.
